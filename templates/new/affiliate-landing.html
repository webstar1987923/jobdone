         Commission is paid once a month upon receiving your invoice. Payment is made on a net 30 basis, which starts at the beginning of the following month. For example: invoices for January 2015 are paid on March 1st/2nd. To cash-out, simply send JobDone your monthly invoice by email.

       Affiliate links contain unique identifiers, allowing us to track anyone directed from your website. Our tracking system captures your URL, which guarantees you are credited for any First-Time-Buyer (FTB) you refer. For example, if someone was directed to JobDone from your link and registered, but didn't make a purchase and then after six months decided to make a purchase, you will still be eligible for commission.

     Commission is 20% for users who are considered First-Time-Buyers (FTBs). Only the first purchase from each customer is payable. Registered and/or previous buyers who make a purchase through your link, are not considered FTBs and therefore won't generate commission.

     This is a common question with a tricky answer. Generally speaking, direct Services preform better then general LPs. However, the best performing "creative" depends on the traffic source. Therefore, business-related blogs convert better with Services, such as tax assistance, business plan help, branding, etc. While tech blogs convert better with Services, such as code review, web design, etc.
