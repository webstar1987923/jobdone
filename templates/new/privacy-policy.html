        <h2>Anonymous data collected through this website</h2>
      </div>
      <p>In addition to the information we collect as described above, we use
      technology to collect anonymous information about the use of our
      website. For example, our web server automatically logs which pages of
      our website our visitors view, their IP addresses and which web
      browsers our visitors use. This technology does not identify you
      personally, it simply enables us to compile statistics about our
      visitors and their use of our website.<br>
      <br>
      Our website contains Hyperlinks to other pages on our website. We may
      use technology to track how often these links are used and which pages
      on our website our visitors choose to view. Again this technology does
      not identify you personally - it simply enables us to compile
      statistics about the use of these Hyperlinks.<br></p>

      <div class="title">
        <h2>Cookies</h2>
      </div>
      <p>In order to collect the anonymous data described in the preceding
      paragraph, we may use temporary "cookies" that remain in the cookies
      file of your browser until the browser is closed. Cookies by themselves
      cannot be used to discover the identity of the user. A cookie is a
      small piece of information which is sent to your browser and stored on
      your computer's hard drive. Cookies do not damage your computer. You
      can set your browser to notify you when you receive a cookie.<br>
      <br>
      This enables you to decide if you want to accept it or not. We also use
      your IP address to help diagnose problems with our server and to
      administer our website. An IP address is a numeric code that identifies
      your computer on a network, or in this case, the Internet. Your IP
      address is also used to gather broad demographic information. We may
      also perform IP lookups to determine which domain you are coming from
      (i.e.: aol.com, yourcompany.com) to more accurately gauge our users'
      demographics.<br></p>
